# HDFC Stock Price Prediction using ARIMA and XGBoost

This project predicts the stock price of HDFC Bank using two models: ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) and XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting). The dataset contains historical stock prices, and we perform the following tasks:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing
- Training the ARIMA model
- Training the XGBoost model
- Evaluation and forecasting of future stock prices
